# email-shadow

In this project, I validate the input form and allows the user to send an email after validation is successful. Also, user will see spinner in case loading of application takes time.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

You need to clone this repository via SSH or HTTPS link provided by GitHub using terminal :
```
git clone git@github.com:nehasadhvi/PersonalTweets-LocalStorage.git
```
or
```
git clone https://github.com/nehasadhvi/PersonalTweets-LocalStorage.git
```

Now, after succesfully cloning the repo, to run the application on your local computer you need to open the local repo using VS Code(highly recommended) and use the "Live Server" extention to run the application on pre-defined port by live server.

This will make your application run on PORT 5500, if in use, on next available port.

Happy Tweeting ! ;)

### Prerequisites

You will need to have an VS Code, Sublime Text or any other IDE of your choice installed on your OS. I prefer VS Code, so you can install it from here:
```
https://code.visualstudio.com/download
```

You will also need to have "Live Server" extention installed on Visual Studio Code of your local computer. You can go to the link and install it : 
```

```
